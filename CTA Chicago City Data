R-CTA_DATA
==========

R and SQL Server were used to analyze CTA data for patterns in ridership over a long time period. Which geographic areas had 
the highest ridership, and map those neighborhoods.

Pull in Census (demographic areas), possibly Real Estate data and see the relationship between change in CTA ridership and other socieconomics of neighborhoods in Chicago.
